The period of artistic, literary, and political activism known as the Chicanx Renaissance flourished in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the United States, although some of its key figures also received important recognition in Europe. The visual arts were an important driving force of this era. Inspired by the ideology of the Chicanx movement, artists mobilized through regional art groups that focused on community-oriented art making. Using such mediums as murals, posters, and silk prints, artists collaborated to create art that represented the issues plaguing the Mexican American community.

Also, Chicanx began using art as a tool to advocate for Gay Liberation. Also, the queer Mexican-American underground movement sought to demonstrate the repercussions of the HIV/Aids epidemic in the 1980s. Chicanx used domestic interiors, gay bars, alternative art spaces, salons, and barriors throughout East Los Angeles to voice their concerns and fight for their rights through photography, painting, performance, and music. Nevertheless, regardless of their efforts, they remained unwelcome within several circles. “While their influence shaped the course of Chicano LGBTQ history, over 40 years later, their efforts still remain widely unknown.” The lack of representation of Chicanx LGBTQ members is due to the homophobia and racism experienced within white queer art institutions. Queer Chicanx faced prejudice from other queer communities and members of El Movimiento due to patriarchal constructs of heterosexism, masculinity, religious visions of motherhood, and traditional views on gender and sexuality. Many Chicano/a’s in the Chicanx art movement, although seen as progressive, followed such rigid principles.
